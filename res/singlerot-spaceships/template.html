  <h1>Spaceships in the Single Rotation rule</h1>

  <p> Below is the list of {patterns:d} different spaceships, supported by the Single Rotation cellular automaton. Of them, 205 were discovered by the random reaction method (catching spaceships, escaping from the random seed); in total 108720436 spaceships were caught and classified. Remaining spaceships were discovered using brute-force search.
</p>
</p>
    The rule is &ldquo;<a href="http://dmishin.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-single-rotation-rule-remarkably.html">Single Rotation</a>&rdquo;, its code string is [0,2,8,3,1,5,6,7,4,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Under this rule, each 2x2 block that contains exactly 1 alive cell, is rotated by 90&deg;, and all other block are left unchanged.
