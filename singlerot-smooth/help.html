    <h1>What is this?</h1>

    <p>It's a simulator of the <a href="http://dmishin.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-single-rotation-rule-remarkably.html">Single Rotation</a> cellular automaton, that tracks positions of the cells and uses Lancsoz interpolation to add an intermediate frames. Its primary purpose is a nice visual effect, for experimenting with reversible cellular automata see <a href="http://dmishin.github.io/js-revca/index.html?rule=0,2,8,3,1,5,6,7,4,9,10,11,12,13,14,15&step=8&frame_delay=100&size=64x64&cell_size=6,1&phase=0">online simulator</a>.

    <h2>Single Rotation rule</h2>
    <p>
      In short, this cellular automaton acts on a grid of cells, each cell can be dead or alive. On each generation, the grid is divided into 2x2 blocks, and if the block contains exactly one alive cell, it is rotated by 90&deg;. Thus "single rotation". After each generation, the 2x2 subdivision is alternated. This scheme is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cellular_automaton">Margolus neighborhood</a>.

      Despite the extreme simpliciry, this rule produces infinitely complex behavior, resembling the iconic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>. One important difference is that "Single Rotation" is time-reversible, that is: for every state it is always possible to calculate previous state. You can play with this rule in the <a href="http://dmishin.github.io/js-revca/index.html?rule=0,2,8,3,1,5,6,7,4,9,10,11,12,13,14,15&step=8&frame_delay=100&size=64x64&cell_size=6,1&phase=0">online simulator</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Cell tracking</h2>
    <p>"Single Rotation" rule also preserves total number of the alive cells. Moreover, from the definition of the rule, it is clear that it is possible to track position of the every individual alive cell. This siumlator does this.
    </p>
    <h2>Interpolation</h2>
    <p>On each generation, alive cells always move by 1 cell in some direciton. To make animation more visually pleasing, this simulator interpolates intermediate positions, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_resampling">Lanczos resampling</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Oscillation filtering</h2>
    <p>One can easily check that in the "Single Rotation" rule a single cell would constantly rotate with period 4. To make this less annoying, a possibility to filter higher frequencies of the cell movement is added. For example, when "filter" setting is 4, then every oscillation with period 4 or less is replaced by the constant averave value, and rotating cells visually stand still. Higher filter setting allow to cease oscillaitions of higher period. This is also done by Lanczos filter.
