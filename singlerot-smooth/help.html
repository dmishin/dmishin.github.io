    <h1>What is this?</h1>

    <p>It's a simulator of
      the <a href="http://dmishin.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-single-rotation-rule-remarkably.html">Single
	Rotation</a> cellular automaton, that tracks positions of the
      cells and uses Lanczos interpolation to add an intermediate
      frames. Its primary purpose is a nice visual effect, for
      experimenting with reversible cellular automata
      see <a href="http://dmishin.github.io/js-revca/index.html?rule=0,2,8,3,1,5,6,7,4,9,10,11,12,13,14,15&step=8&frame_delay=100&size=64x64&cell_size=6,1&phase=0">online

    <h2>Single Rotation rule</h2>
    <p>
      In short, this cellular automaton acts on a grid of cells, each cell can be dead or alive. On each generation, the grid is divided into 2x2 blocks, and if the block contains exactly one alive cell, it is rotated by 90&deg;. Thus "single rotation". After each generation, the 2x2 subdivision is alternated. This scheme is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cellular_automaton">Margolus neighborhood</a>.

    <p>
      Despite the extreme simplicity, this rule produces infinitely complex behavior, resembling the iconic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>. One important difference is that "Single Rotation" is time-reversible, that is: for every state it is always possible to calculate previous state. You can play with this rule in the <a href="http://dmishin.github.io/js-revca/index.html?rule=0,2,8,3,1,5,6,7,4,9,10,11,12,13,14,15&step=8&frame_delay=100&size=64x64&cell_size=6,1&phase=0">online simulator</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Cell tracking</h2>
    <p>"Single Rotation" rule also preserves total number of the alive cells. Moreover, from the definition of the rule it is clear that it is possible to track position of the every individual alive cell. This simulator does this.
    </p>
    <h2>Interpolation</h2>
    <p>Cell coordinates are discrete, alive cells are "jumping" by 1 in some direction. To make animation more visually pleasing, this simulator interpolates intermediate positions, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_resampling">Lanczos resampling</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Oscillation filtering</h2>
    <p>One can easily check that in the "Single Rotation" rule a single cell would constantly rotate with period 4. To make this less annoying, a possibility to filter higher frequencies of the cell movement is added. For example, when "filter" setting is 4, then every oscillation with period 4 or less is replaced by the constant average value, and rotating cells visually stand still. Higher filter setting allow to cease oscillations of higher period. This is also done by Lanczos filter.
    </p>
    <h2>Using the simulator</h2>
    <h3><a name="language"></a>Scene description language</h3>
    <p>Both 3d and 2d simulators use a simple language to describe loaded scenes, that is superset of the RLE (i.e. bare RLE code for the pattern is a valid scene description). The language makes it simpler to combine multiple patterns and assign colors to cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scene is described by a sequence of statements, separated by newlines or ";". Statement names are case-sensitive.
      Four statements are supported:
      <dl>
	<dt><span class="command">at</span> <span class="arg1">X<span> <span class="arg2">Y</span></dt>
	<dd>Sets current origin to the cell with coordinates <span class="arg1">X</span>, <span class="arg2">Y</span>. Used by the following <span class="command">rle</span> commands.</dd>
	<dt><span class="command">--</span> <span class="arg1">TEXT</span></dt>
	<dd>Defines description text. Several lines may be defined. Text can not contain semicolons (;).</dd>
	
	<dt><span class="arg1">PATTERN_RLE</span></dt>
	<dd>Puts given RLE code at the current coorinates. Rle code is a standard format, used by many cellular automata simulators.
	  <ul><li><span class="command">b</span> encodes empty cell,</li>
	    <li><span class="command">o</span> - alive cell,</li>
	    <li><span class="command">$</span> - new line,</li>
	    <li>numbers encode repeat count of the following character.</li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><span class="command">colors</span> <span class="arg1">COLOR-LIST</span></dt>
	<dd>Sets current color palette. When adding patterns, new cell colors are taken from this pattern.
	  <span class="arg1">COLOR-LIST</span> can be either a ":"-separated list of any CSS colors, or the text "default". In the latter case, pattern is returned to the default. Example: <span class="command">colors</span> <span class="arg1">red:#00ff00:rgb(0,0,255)</span>.
	</dd>
      </dl>
      Effect of the <span class="command">at</span> and <span class="command">colors</span> statements lasts until they are redefined. Additional spaces and empty lines are ignored.
