## Sulfates
Salts of sulfuric acid {H2SO4}. Sulfates are generally a good material for growing crystals, because of thei stability and solubility.

* [Potassium sulfate](@root/crystals/potassium-sulfate//), {K2SO4}
* [Copper(II) sulfate](@root/crystals/copper-sulfate//), {CuSO4*5H2O}

Sulfuric acid also forms salts or adducts with some organic compounds and complex ions.

* [Triglycine sulfate](@root/crystals/triglycine-sulfate//) {3NH2CH2COOH*H2SO4}
* [Carbamato zinc sulfate](@root/crystals/urea-zinc-sulfate//) {[Zn(CON2H4)6]SO4*?H2O}
### Double sulfates: Tutton's salts
There are many sulfates that have 2 different matals in it, in stoichiometric proportion. They form several families of similar compounds. Tutton's salts are compounds of general formula: {M^I2M^(II)(SO4)2*6H2O}, where {M^I} and {M^(II)} stand for univalent and bivalent anions. In minerelogy, they are called schoenites.


* [Ammonium zinc sulfate](@root/crystals/ammonium-zinc-sulfate//) {(NH4)2Zn(SO4)2*6H2O}
* [Ammonium iron(II) sulfate](@root/crystals/mohr-salt//) {(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2*6H2O}, also known as Mohr's salt.
* [Potassium magnesium sulfate](@root/crystals/potassium-magnesium-sulfate//) {KMg(SO4)2*6H2O}, mineral schoenite.

### Double sulfates: bloedite family
Bloedites are similar to tutton's salts (schienites), but have 4 molecules of water. They also can include {Na} ions.

* [Sodium zinc sulfate](@root/crystals/zinc-sodium-sulfate//) {Na2Zn(SO4)2*4H2O}, mineral Changoite.

### Double sulfates: alums
They form several families of similar compounds. Tutton's salts are compounds of general formula: {M^IM^(III)(SO4)2*12H2O}, where {M^I} and {M^(II)} stand for univalent and bivalent anions.

* [Potassium Aluminum sulfate](@root/crystals/potassium-alum//) {KAl(SO4)2*12H2O}, usually called alum or potassium alum.
* [Ammonium Iron(III) sulfate](@root/crystals/ferric-alum//) {NH4Fe(SO4)2*12H2O}, or ferric alum.

## Acetates
Salts of acetic acid.

* [Calcium copper acetate](@root/crystals/calcium-copper-acetate//) {CuCa(CH3COO)4*6H2O}
* [Copper acetate](@root/crystals/copper-acetate//) {Cu(CH3COO)2*H2O}

## Nitrates
Salts of nitric acids {HNO3}. Most of nitrates are extremely solubile in water and deliquescent, which makes them badly suited for growing.

* [Ammonium calcium nitrate](@root/crystals/ammonium-calcium-nitrate//) {5Ca(NO3)2*NH4NO3*10H2O}

## Chlorides
* [Sodium Chloride](@root/crystals/sodium-chloride//) {NaCl}, table salt


## Organic
* [Glucose sodium chloride](@root/crystals/glucose-sodium-chloride//) {2C6H12O6*NaCl*H2O} cocrystal of glucose and table salt
* [Urea citrate](@root/crystals/urea-citrate//) {CO(NH2)2*C3H4(OH)(COOH)3} cocrystal of urea and citric acid.

## Other
* [Sodium tetraborate](@root/crystals/borax//) {Na2B4O7*10H2O}, known as borax
* [Potassium tris(oxalato) aluminate](@root/crystals/potassium-trioxalato-aluminate//) {K3[Al(C2O4)3]}
* [Sodium Potassium tartrate](@root/crystals/rochelle-salt//) {}, Rochelle salt
* [Sodium citrate](@root/crystals/sodium-citrate//) {Na3C3H4(OH)(COO)3*?H2O}
