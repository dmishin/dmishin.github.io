Product of dissolving rust in oxalic acid ({H2C2O4}) in presence of sodium oxalate. Surprisingly for an iron (III) compound, has bright green color. A well-known example of coordination complex.

## Properties
* **Color**: bright green
* **Stability on air**: not stable, dehydrate after a day on dry air. Store in tightly closed container.

## Preparation
I used the following procedure:

1. Prepare iron (III) hydroxide {Fe(OH)3}. Oxide {Fe2O3}, and intermediates between them are good too, though they are less reactive. Easiest way is reaction between {FeCl3} and {NaOH} or soda NaHCO3. Or just get some rust.

2. Dissolve {Fe(OH)3} in hot oxalic acid solution, taking 3 moles of acid per 1 mole of {Fe(OH)3}. This would produce dark greenish-brown solution of iron (III) oxalate

3. Neutralize excess of acid with NaOH or soda. Brown solution would turn bright green - color of the complex ion {[Fe(C2O4)3]^(3+)}. Filter it and crystallize the compound from it.

Total equation is:

{Fe(OH)3 + 3H2C2O4 + 3NaHCO3 -> Na3[Fe(C2O4)3] + 6H2O + CO2}

## Growing
My samples were grown using slow evaporation method, growth time is 2 weeks. The compound crystallizes very well, large and transparent crystals are easy to get. Solubility is much bigger than of potassium analog, my rough estimate is about 60g/100ml.

According to the literature, the compound is light sensitive, decomposing on strong light. It appears to be stable under regular room light though.
## Safety
It is not especially dangerous, though significant amounts of oxalates can be poisonous.
