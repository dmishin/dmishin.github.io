Product of dissolving rust in oxalic acid ({H2C2O4}) in presence of sodium oxalate. Surprisingly for an iron (III) compound, has bright green color. A well-known example of coordination complex.

## Properties
* **Color**: bright green
* **Stability on air**: not stable, dehydrate after a day on dry air. Store in tightly closed container.
## Preparation
Dissolve iron (III) oxide or hydroxide in oxalic acid, then add sodium oxalate. Excess acid can be neutralized with soda. My approach was to dissolve iron hydroxide in 2x amount of acid and then neutralize half of acid with soda ({NaHCO3}), thus producing sodium oxalate. Total equation is:

{Fe(OH)3 + 3H2C2O4 + 3NaHCO3 -> Na3[Fe(C2O4)3] + 6H2O + CO2}

## Growing
My samples were grown using slow evaporation method, growth time is 2 weeks. The ocmpound crystallizes very well, large and transparent crystals are easy to get. Solubility is much bigger than of potassium analog, my rough estimate is about 60g/100ml.

According to the literature, the compound is light sensitive, decomposing on strong light. It appears to be stable under regular room light though.
## Safety
It is not especially dangerous, though significant amounts of oxalates can be poisonous.
