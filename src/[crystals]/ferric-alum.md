## Properties
**Crystal system**: isometric

**Crystal shape**: octaheders

**Stability on air**: not stable. On air, crystals start dehydrate, losing color and transparency in less than one day. They can be stored in a tightly closed container with a moisture source (a piece of tissue, wetted in the saturated solution of the same compound), or under oil or some other hydrophobic liquid.
