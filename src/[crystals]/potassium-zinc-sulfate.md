Potassium twin of [ammonium zinc sulfate](@root/crystals/ammonium-zinc-sulfate//), visually indistinguishable from it. I suspect that presice measurement couldshow subtle differences in angles, but for the naked eye, these compounds look the same. Similarly, baking soda can be used to improve crystal quality

## Properties
* **Crystal system**: monoclinic
* **Stability on air**: stable.

## Preparation
Prepare compound by dissolving equimolar amounts of zinc sulfate ({ZnSO4*7H2O}) and potassium sulfate ({K2SO4}) in hot water, then crystallize.

Zinc sulfate can be prepared by dissolving in sulfuric acid metallic zinc:

{Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2(g)}

or, preferably, zinc oxide ({ZnO}), used as white pigment:

{ZnO + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2O}

The second reaction is preferable, because it does not produce gas.

Potassium sulfate is a common fertilizer. However, fertilizer-grade {K2SO4} often contains significant amount of potash {K2CO3}. This can be fixed by adding sulfuric acid in small amounts, until fizzing stops.

## Growing
Similarly to the [ammonium analog](@root/crystals/ammonium-zinc-sulfate//), there is a secret in making extremely transarent crystals.

After preparing solution, add small amount of baking soda {NaHCO3} to it. I used 1g of soda per 100ml of saturated solution. Stir the solution; soon, reaction starts that produces gas ({CO2}) and some white sediment ({ZnCO3}).

Let the solution stay undisturbed for a day (it is needed for completing reaction and forming sediment), filter it and use for growing.

Crystals, grown from such solution, would be much clear.

## Safety
Despite zinc is important for health, in large amounts zinc compounds are moderately toxic.
