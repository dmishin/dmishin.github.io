## Properties
* **Crystal system**: monoclinic
* **Crystal shape**: flat slant prisms with rhombic base, very different from the shape of [pure schoenite](@root/crystals/potassium-magnesium-sulfate//).
* **Color**: light blue, much lighter than copper sulfate
* **Stability on air**: stable

## Preparation
Mix {K2Cu(SO4)2*6H2O} and {K2Mg(SO4)2*6H2O} approximately in 1:1 ratio, dissolve in water and crystallize.

## Safety
Mildly toxic as all copper compounds
