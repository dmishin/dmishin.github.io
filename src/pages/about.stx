title: About me
---
I write code (mostly in Python and C++), admire mathematics, sometimes teach students and make amateur-level chemistry experiments.

Over the time, list various things I put into the Internet under my real name grew, so it is probably the time to make a single place for it: this site.

# Other places

* [My blog](https://dmishin.blogspot.com) updated with constant irregularity.
* [Sources on Github](https://github.com/dmishin), for all projects that do at least something.
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/dmishin) - so far I am most active there. See also [/r/crystalgrowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/crystalgrowing/) - a subreddit about growing crystals.
* [Imgur galleries](http://dmishin.imgur.com/) mostly of crystal images. All my images are free to use without notification.
* [vk.com](https://vk.com/id197008399)
* [twitter](https://twitter.com/shin_dmitry) - still not sure what to use it for
