## Properties
* **Crystal system**: [isometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system) (cubic)
* **Crystal shape**: octahedrons
* **Stability on air**: stable

## Preparation
This compound usually available in chemical shops, but can be prepared too.
Since it has relatively low solubility, it will readily crystallize from any solution, containing enough of {K^+, Al^(3+), SO4^(2-)} ions.

Some possible ways are:

* Dissolve Al in sulfuric acid, producing {Al2(SO4)3}. Reaction is very slow due to protective film on aluminum. Then add {K2SO4} and crystallize.
* Dissolve Al in {KOH} (warning: reaction very intensive, can start boiling), getting potassium aluminate: <br/>
{Al + KOH + 3H2O -> K[Al(OH)4] + 3H2(g)}. <br/>
Then add sulfuric acid:<br/>
{K[Al(OH)4] + 2H2SO4 -> KAl(SO4)2 + 2H2O}


## Growing

I used the simplest, traditional growing method: slow evaporation.'

Prepare a glass of saturated solution, make a small seed crystal and suspend the seed on a thin thread (very fine synthetic fiber, almost invisible).

Common problems in growing alum crystals:

* **Crust formation**: crystalline crust grows slowly on the sides of the glass, depleting the solution and slowing down crystal growth. Solved by moving crystal to a clean glass (crust can be re-dissolved and used again).
* **Mold**: some molds and bacteria can thrive in concentrated alum solution, dimming the crystal and reducing evaporation. I solved it by adding a few drops of iodine tincture.

## Safety
This compound is safe.
