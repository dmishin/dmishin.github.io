## Preparation
I prepared it by reaction of lithium hydroxide and dilute sulfuric acid:

{2LiOH + H2SO4 = Li2SO4 + H2O}

## Growing

As always, I used slow evaporation method to grow the crystals. Growing was complicated by very strong tendency of lithium sulfate solution to creep.

It seems that pH affects crystal morphology: alcaline pH produces very thin plates, while from acidic solutions thicker plates grow.

## Safety
Lithium has low acute toxicity, but consumption of it must be avoided.
