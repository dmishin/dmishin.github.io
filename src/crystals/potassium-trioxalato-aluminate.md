## Properties
* **Crystal system**: monoclinic
* **Crystal shape**: elongated prisms, sticks
* **Color**: colorless
* **Stability on air**: not stable, crystals start cracking after several days on air, eventually turning white. More stable than sodium salt though.
## Preparation
The simplest procedure is: dissolve metallic aluminium in aqueous {KaOH} solution, taking 3 mols of {KOH} for each mol of Al. Then add 3 mols of oxalic acid. Initially, addition of oxalic acid causes white {Al(OH)3} to precipitate, but after heating an stirring, the precipitate dissolves in acid, forming alumooxalate complex. Then filter the solution and let it crystallize. Total equation of the reaction is:

{2 Al + 6 KOH + 6 H2C2O4*2H2O = 2 K3[Al(C2O4)3] + 3 H2 + 18 H2O}

## Growing

I used slow evaporation method, as always. Solubility of the salt at room temperature is not very high, below 20g/100ml. It increases with temperature, so slow cooling crystallization method could work well.

## Safety

All oxalates are moderately toxic. The biggest safety risk, however, is the preparation step. Reaction of metallic {Al} with {KOH} solution is very exothermic and tend to go runaway when done on a larger scale, don't drop all the aluminium at once. Beware of the extremely irritating alkaline aerosol that is produced in this reaction.
