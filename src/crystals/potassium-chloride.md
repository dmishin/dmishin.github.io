Potassium chloride is a potassium analog of a [table salt](@root/crystals/sodium-chloride//). It has the same cubic crystalline structure and shape of crystals. Large crystals are easy to grow, but often get cloudy and badly formed.

## Properties
* **Crystal system**: isometric
* **Crystal shape**: cuboid
* **Color**: colorless
* **Stability on air**: very stable

## Obtaining
Potassium chloride is used as a fertilizer and can be obtained in gardenig stores, but precence of chloride ion makes it less popular choice than other potassium fertilizers.

## Growing
Potassium chloride grows much more easily than [NaCl](@root/crystals/sodium-chloride//). I used slov evapotation to produce the samples on photos.

Its solubility changes a lot with temperature: 34g/100ml at 20&deg;C; and 51.3g/100ml at 80&deg;C. However, in my experiments cooling of saturated solution only produced large number os thin needle-like crystals.

## Safety
This compound is safe.

* [Sodium chloride](@root/crystals/sodium-chloride//), {NaCl}. It has same crystal structure and shape, but is much harder to grow.
* [Glucuse sodium chloride](@root/crystals/glucose-sodium-chloride//), {2C6H12O6*NaCl*H2O}. THis is a cocrystal of table salt and glucose sugar. It has completely different crystal shape and structure, and also an easy compound to grow.
