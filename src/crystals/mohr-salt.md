<span class="cut">Details ...</span>
Double sulfate of divalent iron and ammonium. Naturally occuring, it is known as mineral [mohrite]().

## Properties
* **Crystal system**: monoclynic
* **Crystal shape**: from pure solution, flat tabular crystals are growing. If solution is conpaminated with {Fe^(3+)} ions, then crystals becoming more elongated.
* **Color**: green
* **Stability on air**: stable, a rare example of stable Iron (II) compound.
## Preparation
Dissolve equimolar amounts of ammonium sulfate ({(NH4)2SO4}) and iron (II) sulfate ({FeSO4*7H2O}) in water with small amount of sulfuric acid, then crystallize. 

## Growing
I used regular evaporation method. On air, solution is prone to slow oxidation, addition of small amount of sulfuric acid suppresses it.

## Safety
The compound is generally safe, though can ittirate skin.
