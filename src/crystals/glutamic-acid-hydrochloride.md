## Properties
* **Crystal system**: orthorombic
* **Crystal appearance**: transparent sticks, rectangular in plane.
* **Stability on air**: seem to be almost stable, but slightly lose transparency over time.

## Preparation
I used 2-step preparation, starting from monosodium glutamate, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid.

### Step 1: prepare glutamic acid
Dissolve monosodium glutamate {C5H8NO4Na} in water, then add stoichiometric amount of sulfuric acid. White soft sediment of glutamic acid precipitates (glutamic acid solubility in water is [0.8g/100ml](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/g1251pis.pdf) ). Do not add sulfuric acid in excess, because it will dissolve the precipitate.

{2C3H5(NH2)(COOH)COONa + H2SO4 -> 2C3H5(NH2)(COOH)2(s) + Na2SO4}

Wash the sediment with cold water.

### Step 2: prepare hydrochloride
Dissolve prepared glutamic acid in stoichiometric amount of hydrochloric acid (excess is acceptable). With mild heating, white sediment quickly dissolves, giving transparent solution. The equation is:

{C3H5(NH2)(COOH)2 + HCl -> C3H5(NH2)(COOH)2*HCl}

The solution can be immediately used for growing crystal, but better recrystallize it to get rid or {Na} and other impurities.

## Growing
My measurements show that solubility at room temperature is around 50g/100ml. Crystals grow well with evaporation method. I added few milliliters of hydrochloric acid to the solution to compensate acid evaporation.

## Safety
The compound is not toxic, but its solution is strongly acidic, it has irritant and corrosive properties, much like hydrochloric acid itself.
