## Properties
* **Crystal system**: monoclinic.
* **Crystal shape**: flat elongated hexagonal tablets.
* **Stability on air**: not stable. After few weeks starts dehydrating, developing growing white spots. Store in tightly closed container.
## Preparation
Borax can be bought ready. However, it can be prepared too, by adding soda ({NaHCO3}) to water suspension of boric acid ({H3BO3}):

{4H3BO3 + 2NaHCO3 -> Na2B4O7 + 7H2O + 2CO2(g)}

## Growing
I used the evaporation method. Growth is complicated by low solubility of borax at room temperature.

Solubility in water: 3.3g/100ml at room temperature, up to 30g in boiling water.

## Safety
Borax is moderately toxic, avoid ingestion.
