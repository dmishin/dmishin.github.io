## Properties
* **Crystal system**:trigonal
* **Crystal shape**:cube, stretched along main diagonal
* **Color**: colorless
* **Stability on air**: stable

## Preparation
Dissolve glucose and sodium bromide in warm water in 2:1 molar ratio, then crystallize. Avoid strong heating that causes drkening of glucose.

## Growing
The compound grows much worse than its [chloride analog](@root/crystals/glucose-sodium-chloride//), it is much more prone to formation of small parasitic crystals. Solubility, by my measurements, is around 130g/100ml.

To grow it, I used slow evaporation method, limiting evaporation speed with cover. Growth time is 1 month.

## Safety
Bromide is slightly toxic, avoid consumption of it.
