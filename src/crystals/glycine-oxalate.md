Formula: {(NH3CH2COOH)2C2O4}

Oxalic acid {H2C2O4} is among the strongest inorganic acids, and can easily form salts with many weak bases such as amino-acid glycine. When one mole of oxalic acid is crystallized together with 2 moles of glycine, transparent sticks of glycine oxalate grows.

Different names: diglycine oxalate, glycinium oxalate.

## Properties
* **Crystal shape**: sticks with rectangular cross-section and slant ends
* **Color**: colorless
* **Stability on air**: stable
* **Optical properties**: displays strong birefringence (see photos below)

## Preparation
Prepare solution containing glycine and oxalic acid in 2:1 molar ratio, then crystallize it. The equation is:

{2NH2CH2COOH + H2C2O4 = (NH3CH2COOH)2C2O4}

## Growing
As always, I used slow evaporation method. Solubility, according to my own measurements, is around 31g/100ml, but it might be a bit off.

## Safety
Oxalic acid is moderately toxic and corrosive.
