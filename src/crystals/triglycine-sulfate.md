## Properties
* **Crystal system**: monoclinic
* **Stability on air**: stable

Triglycine sulfate has an interesting physical property: strong [birefringence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence):

## Preparation
Dissolve glycine and sulfuric acid in water, in 3:1 molar ratio, then crystallize.

## Growing
Regular slow evaporation method used. Solubility is not much different from pure glycine, around 20..30g per 100ml.

## Safety
The compound is not toxic, but since glycine is a very weak base, its solution is very acidic. Thus, it have corrosive and irritating properties, and even can cause burns.
