Crystals of little-known sodium boroformate, for which the literature gives a formula {NaH2CO3*2HCOOH*2H2O}. However, how exactly the ions of this substance are arranged is unknown to me. The formula only gives the ratio of sodium, borate, and formate. I strongly suspect that two molecules of formic acid are chemically bound to borate.

## Properties
* **Crystal shape**: flat, elongated hexagons with striations on side faces
* **Color**: colorless, transparent
* **Stability on air**: stable
## Preparation
Dissolve in water borax, soda (or NaOH) and formic acid in a 1:2:8 molar ratio. The compound crystallizes upon evaporation of the solution.

{ Na2B4O7*10H2O + 2 NaOH + 8 HCOOH + H2O -> 4 NaH2BO3*2HCOOH*2H2O }
## Growing
Grown using slow evaporation method. Solubility at room temperature is aroung 10..15g/100ml.

## Safety
Boric acid and borates, as well as formates are only moderately toxic. However, free formic acid used in preparation is dangerous. Its vapors cause severe irritation, and even short contact of with unprotected skin can cause serious burns, sometimes not immediately.
