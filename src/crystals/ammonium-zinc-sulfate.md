## Properties
* **Crystal system**: monoclinic
* **Stability on air**: stable. After many months, crystals showing no signs of dehydration.


## Preparation
Prepare compound by dissolving equimolar amounts of zinc sulfate ({ZnSO4*7H2O}) and ammonium sulfate ({(NH4)2SO4}) in water. It is less soluble than its constituents, so it will crystallize when hot satrated solutions are mixed.

Zinc sulfate can be prepared by dissolving in sulfuric acid metallic zinc:

{Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2(g)}

or, preferably, zinc oxide ({ZnO}), used as white pigment:

{ZnO + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2O}

The second reaction is preferable, because it does not produce gas.

Ammonium sulfate is sometimes sold as fertilizer. It can be prepared by mixing ammonia solution with sulfuric acid (warning: reaction is very exoteric and can start boiling, irritating fumes of ammonia are produced when reaction is not yet complete):

{2NH3 + H2SO4 -> (NH4)2SO4}


## Growing
There is a secret in making extremely transarent crystals.

After preparing solution, add small amount of baking soda {NaHCO3} to it. I used 1g of soda per 100ml of saturated solution. Stir the solution; soon, reaction starts that produces gas ({CO2}) and some white sediment ({ZnCO3}).

Let the solution stay undisturbed for a day (it is needed for completing reaction and forming sediment), filter it and use for growing.

Crystals, grown from such solution, would be brilliantly clear.

## Safety
Despite zinc is important for health, in large amounts zinc compounds are moderately toxic.
