## Properties
* **Crystal system**: hexagonal! The rarest crystal system in my collection.
* **Crystal shape**: straight faceted hexagonal prism.
* **Color**: colorless.
* **Stability on air**: stable (anhydrous)
## Preparation

Double salt can be prepared by dissolving individual sulfates in water and crystallizing the solution:

{K2SO4 + Li2SO4 = 2KLiSO4}

However, the double salt does not crystallize from a stoichiometric solution, containing equal amounts of both ions. According to [the literature](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4977190), double salt crystallizes at room temperature, when {K2SO4} : {Li2SO4} mass ratio lies between 0.05 and 0.4. This corresponds to molar ratio range from 0.03 to 0.43. Thus, more than twofold excess of {Li2SO4} must be present in the solution in order to crystallize the double salt.

## Growing

Slow evaporation method was used. Growing is complicated by the non-stoichiometric composition of the solution. Concentration of {K} gradually drops as the double salt crystallizes. When it reaches the lower bound (approximately when half of the solution has evaporated), elongated crystals of [lithium sulfate](@root/crystals/lithium-sulfate//) start growing instead; they can ruin the seed.

## Safety
Potassium is not toxic, and lithium has low acute toxicity, though consumption must be avoided.
