    <h2><a href="t2dca/2dca.html">Simulator of cellular automata with 2 dimensions of time</a></h2>
    <p> Simulate elementary cellular automata with 1 spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. Simulation result is displayed as static 3d object, visualized with Tree.js.
      </p>
    <p>See also <a href="http://dmishin.blogspot.com/2014/06/cellular-automata-with-2-temporal.html">blog post</a> about it.

    <h2><a href="singlerot-spaceships/singlerot-spaceships.html">Spaceships of teh Single Rotation rule</a></h2>
    <p>Single Rotation is a simple reversible cellular automaton, that operates on a field with Margolus neighborhood. Random initial conditions in this rule produce lots of different spaceships, some of them are in this catalog.</p>
